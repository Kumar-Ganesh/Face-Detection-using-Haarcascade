# Face-Detection-using-Haarcascade

## Project Description
This repository contains a Face Detection project implemented using Haarcascade, a machine learning-based approach for face detection. The project uses OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks, to detect human faces in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time Face Detection: Detects faces in real-time from webcam feed.
- Customizable: Adjust detection parameters for different environments and requirements.

## Haarcascade Files
The project uses pre-trained Haarcascade models for face detection. These models are included in the haarcascades directory.
